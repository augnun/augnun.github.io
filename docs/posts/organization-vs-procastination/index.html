    <p>During undergrad school I leaned heavily on <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a>. It did a really good job on keeping me up with a few hard to grasp concepts and formulas, while <em>muscling up</em> my memory with many banal stuff in a few harder courses. It was fun, easy and readily actionable, you can get instant feedback on how you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>Even though I loved it, I haven&rsquo;t touched it properly in years. I&rsquo;ve tried, but memorizing formulas doesn&rsquo;t seem that valuable anymore. I am perfunctorily interesting in learning new languages, and people are really keen on Anki flashcards for this purpose also: they can contain multimedia, formats which differ from the basic front/back etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost a self-taught english speaker, albeit I&rsquo;m not that secure with my conversational skills. Maybe I&rsquo;ll take a conversation class or make some english speaking friends. I think of myself as possessing a decent fluency in written english, but that&rsquo;s just not enough.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the main point of this: I think Anki is a great tool, but I couldn&rsquo;t separate this from being a chore. To be really effective you have to consistently revisit material, make new notes, delete others etc. I think all systems suppose a certain ammount of upkeep, and I&rsquo;ve tried many, many learning and organizational methods like GTD, ZTD and, most recently, <a href="https://zettelkasten.de"><em>Zettelkasten</em></a>, but none of them ignited the fire, the passion that I had while using Anki in college.</p>
