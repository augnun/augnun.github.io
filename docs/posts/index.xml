      <description>Leopoldo Luque died today from Covid-19 complications.&#xA;Last year the Argentinian journal El Clar√≠n published his chilling account of almost being killed by the Argentinian dictatorship.</description>

      <description>Recently I saw on Hacker News a very nice blog post about disqus: it always seemed to me like a shady tool, ubiquitous but at the same time leading to some potential privacy risks.&#xA;Supun Kavinda&amp;rsquo;s very nice explanation puts a light to this problem which.</description>

      <description>Well, I was very aggravated by Jekyll, Ruby and all it&amp;rsquo;s dependency management, environment setup etc.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s try using Hugo this time. Maybe I can learn Go and finally kickstart this blogging project.&#xA;Here goes nothing!</description>

      <description>During undergrad school I leaned heavily on Anki. It did a really good job on keeping me up with a few hard to grasp concepts and formulas, while muscling up my memory with many banal stuff in a few harder courses. It was fun, easy and readily actionable, you can get instant feedback on how you&amp;rsquo;re going.&#xA;Even though I loved it, I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched it properly in years. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, but memorizing formulas doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem that valuable anymore.</description>

      <title>Zizek vs Self: On Dangerous Ideas</title>

      <description>This is an interesting debate between the slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek and british author Will Self. I think that they present a important (im)balance between academicism and ideology - represented by Zizek&amp;rsquo;s incessant references and hegelianism and an enormous amount of cinicism and pessimism personified by Self.&#xA;I love both authors. Self has written a few books which I found quite enjoyable: Great Apes, How the Dead Live and The Book of Dave alternate between humor which is often dark and twisted, tenderness and societal pessimism.</description>
