      <title>Zizek vs Self: On Dangerous Ideas</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting debate between the slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek and british author Will Self. I think that they present a important (im)balance between academicism and ideology - represented by Zizek&amp;rsquo;s incessant references and hegelianism and an enormous amount of cinicism and pessimism personified by Self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love both authors. Self has written a few books which I found quite enjoyable: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.librarything.com/work/28486&#34;&gt;Great Apes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.librarything.com/work/2451396&#34;&gt;How the Dead Live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.librarything.com/work/752948&#34;&gt;The Book of Dave&lt;/a&gt; alternate between humor which is often dark and twisted, tenderness and societal pessimism. His presentation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography&#34;&gt;Psychogeography&lt;/a&gt; is provoking, albeit without much of the revolutionary &lt;em&gt;Ã©lan&lt;/em&gt; enforced originally by Debord &lt;em&gt;et caterva&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zizek has written one of my favorite books: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.librarything.com/work/8998398&#34;&gt;First as Tragedy, Then as Farce&lt;/a&gt;. Zizek has wit, revolutionary edge and enough political baggage to present a very compelling argument in favor of his flavor of Communism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always: don&amp;rsquo;t read the video comments. People have greatly misunderstood the interaction between them: they think Self is childish and narcisistic, but he is merely presenting himself as a staunch cynic, pessimist and skeptical of revolutionary action. I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly agree with him specifically in the last point, but I think he presents this sincerely and must be recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
