      <description>This is an interesting debate between the slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek and british author Will Self. I think that they present a important (im)balance between academicism and ideology - represented by Zizek&amp;rsquo;s incessant references and hegelianism and an enormous amount of cinicism and pessimism personified by Self.&#xA;I love both authors. Self has written a few books which I found quite enjoyable: Great Apes, How the Dead Live and The Book of Dave alternate between humor which is often dark and twisted, tenderness and societal pessimism.</description>
