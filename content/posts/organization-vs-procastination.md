During undergrad school I leaned heavily on [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net). It did a really good job on keeping me up with a few hard to grasp concepts and formulas, while _muscling up_ my memory with many banal stuff in a few harder courses. It was fun, easy and readily actionable, you can get instant feedback on how you're going.

Even though I loved it, I haven't touched it properly in years. I've tried, but memorizing formulas doesn't seem that valuable anymore. I am perfunctorily interesting in learning new languages, and people are really keen on Anki flashcards for this purpose also: they can contain multimedia, formats which differ from the basic front/back etc. 

I'm almost a self-taught english speaker, albeit I'm not that secure with my conversational skills. Maybe I'll take a conversation class or make some english speaking friends. I think of myself as possessing a decent fluency in written english, but that's just not enough.

But that's not the main point of this: I think Anki is a great tool, but I couldn't separate this from being a chore. To be really effective you have to consistently revisit material, make new notes, delete others etc. I think all systems suppose a certain ammount of upkeep, and I've tried many, many learning and organizational methods like GTD, ZTD and, most recently, [_Zettelkasten_](https://zettelkasten.de), but none of them ignited the fire, the passion that I had while using Anki in college.
