This is an interesting debate between the slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek and british author Will Self. I think that they present a important (im)balance between academicism and ideology - represented by Zizek's incessant references and hegelianism and an enormous amount of cinicism and pessimism personified by Self.

I love both authors. Self has written a few books which I found quite enjoyable: [Great Apes](https://www.librarything.com/work/28486), [How the Dead Live](https://www.librarything.com/work/2451396) and [The Book of Dave](https://www.librarything.com/work/752948) alternate between humor which is often dark and twisted, tenderness and societal pessimism. His presentation of [Psychogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography) is provoking, albeit without much of the revolutionary _Ã©lan_ enforced originally by Debord _et caterva_.

Zizek has written one of my favorite books: [First as Tragedy, Then as Farce](https://www.librarything.com/work/8998398). Zizek has wit, revolutionary edge and enough political baggage to present a very compelling argument in favor of his flavor of Communism. 

As always: don't read the video comments. People have greatly misunderstood the interaction between them: they think Self is childish and narcisistic, but he is merely presenting himself as a staunch cynic, pessimist and skeptical of revolutionary action. I don't particularly agree with him specifically in the last point, but I think he presents this sincerely and must be recognized.
