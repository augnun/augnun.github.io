This negates the reduction in taxable income (the unspent monthly subway fund drawn from our paycheck may be the equivalent of any taxes saved).

I realize that we can alter our subway fund each month, but the current system for doing so is slow and tedious. It would be better if we can pause our use of the system via an online process.
